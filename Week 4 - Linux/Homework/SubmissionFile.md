## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod /etc/group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): sudo useradd sam
                                                                 sudo useradd joe
                                                                 sudo useradd amy
                                                                 sudo useradd sara
                                                                 sudo useradd admin
2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users): sudo usermod -G engineers sam
                                                                          sudo usermod -G engineers joe
                                                                          sudo usermod -G engineers amy
                                                                          sudo usermod -G engineers sara
                                                                          sudo usermod -G engineers admin
3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir -p /home/engineers

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chgrp -R engineers /home/engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt-get install lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: man lynis

3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
